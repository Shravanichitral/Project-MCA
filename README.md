The OrderEase is a mobile application designed for students and staff, facilitating the seamless ordering and payment of food from the college canteen through their smartphones, specifically on the Android platform. One of the app's key features is the integration of an e-wallet system, promoting cashless transactions and enhancing overall convenience for users.  
Users of OrderEase can efficiently navigate through the canteen menu using the app, and they receive timely notifications alerting them when their ordered food is ready for pickup. This feature significantly improves the ordering experience by eliminating the need to physically visit the cafeteria and endure long queues, providing a more efficient and user-friendly process.  
On the admin side, canteen admins are equipped with a dedicated interface within the app. This interface empowers administrators to manage various aspects of the canteen operations, including inventory management, item addition, item deletion, and tracking orders that are Out for Delivery. This administrative functionality contributes to the optimization of the entire food service experience within college campuses.  

Traditional college canteens often face several challenges that can lead to a less than optimal dining experience for students and staff. Some of the common problems faced in such canteens include:  
•	Long waiting queues.  
•	limited information about food availability.  
Canteen administrators face challenges in managing food items, availability, and order communication.
